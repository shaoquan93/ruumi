### Setting up Hyperledger Blockchain
Navigate to ~/composer-playground on the Vagrant Virtual Machine Cloud IDE and issue the following command:
```
./playground.sh up
```
This will start the composer playground container:

In order to create a network, a valid user credential on the certificate authority is necessary. 
Return to the cloud IDE, and exit the display of log using Ctrl-C.
Create a registrar user account on the certificate authority using the command:
```
docker exec -it ca.org1.example.com fabric-ca-client enroll -M registrar -u
http://admin:adminpw@localhost:7054
```
After which, you can use the credentials of the registrar to further create many user accounts using:
```
docker exec -it ca.org1.example.com fabric-ca-client register -M registrar -u
http://localhost:7054 --id.name <user_id> --id.affiliation org1 --id.attrs
'"hf.Registrar.Roles=client"' --id.type user
```
When the user is created, A corresponding password is also printed out.
Going back to the composer playground, to start a new business network, click on “Deploy a new
business network” under the ‘hlfv1’ connection.
Import in the .bna file provided.
Provide a new network admin name, and network admin card name(this will show in the composer playground registry), use one of the sample networks as a base template.
Credentials for the network admin should be created using ‘ID and Secret’ method, using the credentials:
Enrollment ID: <user id>
Enrollment secret: <password returned from CA>
Once the business network is created(this can take a few minutes), you will be moved to the network
editor screen. 
At this point, the business network is ready to be used
